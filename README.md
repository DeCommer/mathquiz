This is a project I am working on as a beginner Java programmer. I am using javafx with scenebuilder and vscode to slog and fumble my way through.
There is not a lot of direction when it comes to javafx I am finding, so this is a good learning experience so far.
I am to that point where I have a GUI up and can give randomly assigned questions with random operators.
There is not yet a connection to be able to answer yet.
